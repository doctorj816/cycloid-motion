# cycloid-motion

The dots all move in a straight line, yet a circle appears to roll/move/rotate around.

After seeing videos on this, I was inspired to make an interactive visualization of it.

Using python, I created a pandas dataframe containing all the points in the animation organized by point number and time/animation frame. I use plotly to "plot" it. You can play the animation through or use the slider to manually scrub through the frames.
